= Additional Routing configuration object

The fields for the `AdditionalRouting` CR are described in the following table:

[options="header"]
|===
| field name | field type | description for field

| spec 
| object
| RouteAdvertisementsSpec defines the desired state of RouteAdvertisements

| spec.advertisements
| object
| Advertisements determines what is advertised.

| spec.advertisements.egressIP
| boolean
| PodNetwork determines if the network EgressIPs should be advertised.

| spec.advertisements.podNetwork
| boolean
| PodNetwork determines if the pod network routes should be advertised.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector
| object
| FrrConfigurationSelector determines which FRRConfiguration will the OVN-Kubernetes driven FRRConfiguration be based on.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector.matchExpressions
| array
| List of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector.matchExpressions[]
| object
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector.matchExpressions[].key
| string
| key is the label key that the selector applies to.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector.matchExpressions[].operator
| string
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector.matchExpressions[].values
| array
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty.

| spec.frrConfigurationSelector.matchLabels
| object
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value".

| spec.networkSelector
| object
| NetworkSelector determines which network routes should be advertised. When omitted, the default cluster network routes are advertised.

| spec.networkSelector.matchExpressions
| array
| List of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| spec.networkSelector.matchExpressions[]
| object
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| spec.networkSelector.matchExpressions[].key
| string
| key is the label key that the selector applies to.

| spec.networkSelector.matchExpressions[].operator
| string
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| spec.networkSelector.matchExpressions[].values
| array
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty.

| spec.networkSelector.matchLabels
| object
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value".

| spec.nodeSelector
| object
| NodeSelector limits the advertisements to selected nodes.

| spec.nodeSelector.matchExpressions
| array
| List of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| spec.nodeSelector.matchExpressions[]
| object
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| spec.nodeSelector.matchExpressions[].key
| string
| key is the label key that the selector applies to.

| spec.nodeSelector.matchExpressions[].operator
| string
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| spec.nodeSelector.matchExpressions[].values
| array
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty.

| spec.nodeSelector.matchLabels
| object
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value".

| spec.targetVRF
| string
| TargetVRF determines which VRF the routes should be advertised in.
