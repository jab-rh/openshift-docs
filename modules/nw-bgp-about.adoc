= Route advertisements with BGP

With route advertisements enabled, {product-title} Networking supports the following features:

- Importing routes from the provider network
- Exporting routes into the provider network
- Supporting multi-homing, link redundancy, and fast convergence for provider network gateways

[id="supported-platforms_{context}"]
== Supported platforms

BGP routing is supported on the following infrastructure types:

- Bare-metal
- {vmw-full} on-premise

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

Use of BGP routing requires that you have properly configured BGP for your network provider. Outages or misconfigurations of your network provider might cause disruptions to your cluster network.

[id="considerations-for-use-with-the-metallb-operator_{context}"]
== Considerations for use with the MetalLB Operator

The MetalLB Operator is installed as an add-on to the cluster. Deployment of the MetalLB Operator automatically enables FRR-K8s as an additional routing capability provider and uses the FRR-K8s daemon installed by this feature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the MetalLB Operator, you must manually copy any existing `FRRConfiguration` CRs in the `metallb-system` namespace to the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace. This includes `FRRConfiguration` CRs created by both cluster administrators and by cluster components.

[id="cluster-network-operator_{context}"]
== Cluster Network Operator configuration

The Cluster Network Operator API exposes the following API field to configure BGP routing:

- `spec.additionalRoutingCapabilities`: Enables deployment of the FRR-K8S daemon for the cluster, which can be used independently of route advertisements. When enabled, the FRR-K8S daemon is deployed on all nodes.

[id="bgp-routing-custom-resources_{context}"]
== BGP routing custom resources

The following custom resources are used to configure BGP routing:

`FRRConfiguration`::
This custom resource defines the FRR configuration for the BGP routing. This CR is namespaced.
